## ***ðŸ“Š Presentation Shared with CCN-CERT***

This folder contains the presentation I originally prepared and shared with the CCN to report the identified vulnerability. Initially, the plan was to schedule a video call to walk them through the issue in detail. However, since I was already in direct contact with someone inside the organization, and they fully understood the nature of the vulnerability and were committed to addressing it promptly, I decided to send all the materials - including this presentation - without requesting a meeting. The goal was to avoid interrupting their ongoing work while still providing all the necessary technical details to support a quick and effective resolution. This presentation outlines the core issue and served as the formal disclosure at the time.
